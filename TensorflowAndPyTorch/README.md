# CNN Implementation in TensorFlow and PyTorch

## Overview

This folder contains notebooks demonstrating how to build and train Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) using TensorFlow and PyTorch. It includes examples for classifying images using standard architectures.

## Contents

- TensorFlow-based CNN model training
- PyTorch-based ResNet18 training and evaluation
- Visualization of training and validation accuracy
- Confusion matrix and performance metrics

## Features

- End-to-end image classification workflow
- Comparison of TensorFlow and PyTorch implementations
- Use of GPU acceleration (if available)
- Clean code and modular structure for training/testing

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- Image dataset (e.g., Cats vs Dogs, CIFAR-10)
- Required Python libraries:
  - tensorflow
  - torch
  - matplotlib
  - numpy
