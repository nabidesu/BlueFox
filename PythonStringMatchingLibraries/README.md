# Python String Matching Libraries

## Overview

This notebook compares various Python libraries for string matching tasks such as fuzzy matching, token-based matching, and phonetic similarity. It is useful for applications like record linkage, name deduplication, and fuzzy searching.

## Contents

- Comparison of string matching libraries: FuzzyWuzzy, RapidFuzz, difflib, etc.
- Token sorting and ratio matching
- Use cases for approximate string matching
- Benchmarking different libraries

## Features

- Demonstrates usage of different string similarity techniques
- Includes real-world examples (e.g., name matching)
- Highlights performance and accuracy differences between libraries

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.7+
- A dataset with string pairs or duplicates
- Required Python libraries:
  - fuzzywuzzy
  - rapidfuzz
  - difflib
  - pandas
